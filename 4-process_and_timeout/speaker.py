# until_start = start - env.now:
# This line calculates the time remaining until the specified start time. env.now represents the current simulation time. If the start time is in the future, until_start will be a positive value, indicating how much time needs to pass before the speaker becomes active.

# yield env.timeout(until_start):
# This line yields a timeout event, effectively pausing the speaker process until the calculated until_start time has passed. The process will resume when the simulation time reaches or exceeds the calculated start time.

# yield env.timeout(30):
# After the initial timeout, this line yields another timeout event, indicating that the speaker will remain active for an additional 30 time units. This could represent a period during which the speaker is actively doing something.
