def generator(x):
    y = yield x + 1
    return y + 1

gen = generator(1)
print(next(gen))       # Start the generator
print(gen.send(3))  # Sends 3 into the generator, resumes execution, and prints the result

# yield x + 1: This line yields the value x + 1 to the caller of the generator when the generator is initially started or resumed. At this point, the generator is paused.

# y = yield x + 1: The generator is resumed when the caller sends a value using the send method. The sent value is assigned to y. This line is where the generator receives a value from the caller.

# return y + 1: After the generator has received a value using yield, it can continue executing until it encounters a return statement. In this case, it returns the result of y + 1.

# The generator is resumed, and the value 3 is assigned to y. Then, the generator continues to execute until it encounters the return statement, which returns y + 1, i.e., 3 + 1 = 4.

# However, in your provided example, the StopIteration exception is raised after calling g.send(3). This is because the generator has reached its end (there are no more yield statements), and the return statement is encountered. In Python 3.3 and later, the StopIteration exception is automatically caught, and its value attribute contains the value returned by the generator (in this case, 4).

# So, the final result of calling g.send(3) is 4, and the StopIteration exception is a normal part of the generator's termination. In practice, you can handle this exception if needed, or you can use a loop and next calls to iterate over the generator until it naturally exits.
